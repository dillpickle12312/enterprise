  <h2 class="intro-header">Physical Activity of Young People</h2>
  This system helps inform students, parents, and educators about physical activity, screen time, and wellbeing trends. According to the World Health Organization and national health bodies such as the Australian Department of Health, it is recommended that young people aged 13–17 engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day to support healthy growth, development, and mental wellbeing. However, in today’s screen-saturated world, many adolescents are falling short of these guidelines.
