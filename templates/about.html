        What we mean by sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity
    </h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.3em; line-height:1.7;">
        Sedentary behaviour is being inactive, either sitting or lying down for long periods (except when sleeping). We spend a lot of time being inactive at school, at work, when travelling or when relaxing.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0.7em; line-height:1.7;">
        A lot of sedentary behaviour involves screen time. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:1.3em; margin-top:0; padding-left:2.1em; line-height:1.7;">
        <li>working or doing homework on a computer</li>
        <li>playing video games</li>
        <li>scrolling social media</li>
        <li>watching TV or movies</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.3em; line-height:1.7;">
        Sedentary behaviour occurs throughout our entire lives. Even babies can be inactive – for example, when strapped in a stroller or car seat. It’s important to keep sedentary time to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.3em; line-height:1.7;">
        Physical inactivity means not meeting the daily physical activity guidelines. You can do enough physical activity to meet the guidelines, and still be sedentary if you spend a lot of time sitting or lying down.
    </p>
    <div style="background:#e3f0fb; border-left:6px solid #1976d2; padding:1.1em 1.7em; margin-bottom:2em; font-size:1.08em; color:#174ea6; font-weight:600;">
        Sedentary behaviour and being physically inactive can result in a higher risk of some health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression.

    <h2 style="font-size:1.35em; font-weight:700; color:#174ea6; margin-bottom:0.7em; margin-top:2em;">
        Guidelines young people should complete
    </h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.1em; line-height:1.7;">
        We recommend young people do at least 60 minutes each day of moderate to vigorous physical activity that makes the heart beat faster. More is better.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.1em; line-height:1.7;">
        It doesn’t have to be a full 60 minutes at once – several shorter sessions through the day work too.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.1em; line-height:1.7;">
        At least 3 days per week, young people should incorporate vigorous activities and activities that strengthen muscle and bone in the 60 minutes.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.1em; line-height:1.7;">
        These activities don’t have to be organised or formal, and can include:
    </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:1.35em; font-weight:700; color:#174ea6; margin-bottom:0.7em; margin-top:2em;">
        Why physical activity is important
    </h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:1.1em; line-height:1.7;">
        Being active is important for good health and wellbeing at any age. Everyone should be active most days, preferably every day.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0.7em; line-height:1.7;">
        Moving more and sitting less helps:
