        <span style="font-weight:600;">Do young people meet the physical activity guidelines?</span><br>
        The Australian physical activity guidelines recommend that adolescents aged 13â€“17 engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day and limit sedentary behaviour, particularly screen-based activity.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight:600;">What does the data show?</span><br>
        The data collected across 80 entries reveals that most users are not meeting these guidelines.
        <ul style="margin-top: 0.7em; margin-bottom: 0.7em;">
            <li>ðŸ”´ Only a small portion of students achieved the recommended 60 minutes of activity per day across multiple days.</li>
            <li>ðŸŸ  Sedentary time, especially screen time, consistently outweighed physical activity, with many students showing low activity-to-sedentary ratios (e.g., 1:4).</li>
            <li>ðŸŸ¡ Most physical activity recorded was light or moderate, with vigorous intensity being the least common.</li>
            <li>ðŸ”µ Students were most active on weekends, highlighting a drop in movement during structured school weeks.</li>
            <li>ðŸŸ¢ Screen time often represented more than 50% of daily sedentary behaviour, pointing to digital distractions as a major barrier to physical health.</li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-weight:600;">Conclusion:</span><br>
        Overall, the data clearly supports the project's core concern: young people are not moving enough, and digital distractions like screens are contributing heavily to sedentary lifestyles. These insights provide a strong foundation for raising awareness and encouraging more balanced, active routines.

        <div class="dashboard-summary-text">
            There is a significant gap between actual activity levels and the recommended standard. None of the users met the guideline of 60 minutes per day (2,700 minutes over 1.5 months). The most active user reached just over 22% of the target. This trend reflects a broader issue within youth behaviour, suggesting that physical inactivity is a widespread concern, and interventions or increased awareness may be necessary to promote healthier, more active lifestyles.

        <div class="dashboard-summary-text">
            The data shows a striking contrast, no student reached even 15% of the recommended total active days. The most active user recorded just 6 active days, while several users logged only 1 day each. This demonstrates a significant shortfall in consistent physical activity, reinforcing the concern that most students are not meeting the basic daily movement requirements. The data highlights the need for increased awareness, motivation, and opportunities to help young people integrate more activity into their daily lives.

            While students are engaging in physical activity, most are not meeting the recommended intensity levels. Only a few users reach close to the suggested amount of vigorous activity (3 days/week). The majority rely on light or moderate intensity, highlighting a need for more high-effort movement to meet health guidelines. According to physical activity guidelines for adolescents, young people should engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily, with vigorous intensity recommended on at least 3 days per week.

        <div class="dashboard-summary-text">
            The Active/Sedentary Ratios chart reveals that most students spend significantly more time being sedentary than active, with no ratio exceeding 0.25. This means that even the most active student is sedentary for four times longer than they are active. According to national guidelines, young people should be active for at least 60 minutes daily and limit screen time to 2 hours. These low ratios indicate that the majority of students are not meeting these recommendations, highlighting a broader issue of insufficient physical activity in youth.

        <div class="dashboard-summary-text">
            The graph shows that average daily screen time ranges from about 190 to 210 minutes, which exceeds the Australian guideline of no more than 120 minutes of recreational screen time per day for young people aged 5â€“17. Screen time is highest on Saturdays, but it remains above the recommended limit on all days. This suggests that screen use may need to be reduced by 1â€“1.5 hours daily to align with health guidelines and support the wellbeing of young people. High screen time can also reduce the time available for physical activity, which is important for healthy growth and development, and can lead to a lack of motivation in young people.

            The graph shows that for each student, total screen time is significantly higher than their total physical activity duration. For example, Mia and Jack have screen times reaching around 2500 and 2300 minutes, while their physical activity duration remains below 600 minutes. All students have consistently higher screen time compared to their activity levels, indicating that screen use is taking up a large portion of their weekly time. This level of screen time exceeds the Australian guideline of no more than 120 minutes of recreational screen time per day for young people aged 5â€“17, highlighting a need to reduce screen time to support a balanced lifestyle. High screen time can reduce opportunities for physical activity, which is important for healthy growth, fitness, and mental wellbeing, and can also lead to a lack of motivation and reduced energy levels in young people.

        <p style="font-size:1.13em; line-height:1.7; margin-bottom:0;">
            The collected data highlights a clear and concerning trend: most young people are not meeting recommended physical activity guidelines and are spending excessive time being sedentary, especially on screens. Very few students achieve the daily or weekly targets for activity duration, intensity, or active days. Screen time consistently exceeds healthy limits, and sedentary behaviour dominates daily routines. These findings reinforce the urgent need for increased awareness, targeted interventions, and supportive environments to help young people move more, sit less, and develop lifelong healthy habits.
